# API Configuration
# IMPORTANT: For local development, VITE_API_BASE_URL should be a relative path (/api)
# The Vite dev server will proxy these requests to VITE_BACKEND_URL

# Base path for API requests
# Development: Use /api (Vite proxy will forward to backend)
# Production: Will be prefixed with VITE_BACKEND_URL
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api

# Backend server URL
# Development: Used for WebSocket connections and production builds
# Production: Full URL of your backend server
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
